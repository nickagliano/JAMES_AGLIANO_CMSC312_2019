Dear Students,

On Blackboard you will find an example template for a program file. This is just a suggestion, showing that each instruction should have assigned an individual time quantum required for its completion. At this point instructions do not have individual memory requirements, this will change when we will move to virtual memory.

The requirements for project part 1 (deadline October 6th) are as follows:

+ having at least 4 of your own program file templates
+ having a procedure that reads these program files and generates user-specified number of processes from them (hence randomization of values from templates must be used)
+ assigning a PCB to each process that stores basic metadata, including process state
+ having a single scheduler that optimizes the process running cycle
+ having a dispatcher that changes the status of each process in real time

All of this must be within a single application, not multiple separate modules.
